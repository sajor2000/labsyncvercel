# Lab Manager - Medical Research Lab Management System

## Overview
LabSync is a comprehensive medical research lab management system designed to streamline research workflows for laboratories like Rush Interdisciplinary Consortium for Critical Care Trials and Data Science (RICCC) and Rush Health Equity Data Analytics Studio (RHEDAS). It provides study lifecycle management, AI-powered standup meetings, real-time collaboration, and task tracking, all under the tagline "Making Science Easier". The system is a full-stack application with a React frontend and Express backend, utilizing PostgreSQL for data persistence and integrating with external services for file storage and AI processing.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
UI/UX Structure: Bucket → Project/Study → Subtasks hierarchy for organization with both Kanban board and Monday.com-style table workflows.
Lab Management: Support for multiple separate research labs with toggle functionality.
Team Flexibility: Allow team members to be in multiple labs (e.g., J.C. Rojas as PI in both RICCC and RHEDAS).
Color Scheme: Slack-inspired dark theme with professional color palette (purple primary, green accent, neutral grays).
Navigation Cleanup: Removed redundant "Task Board" page since Task Management already includes kanban view.

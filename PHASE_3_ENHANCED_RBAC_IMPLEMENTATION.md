# Phase 3: Enhanced RBAC & Cross-Lab Security Implementation

## Overview
Phase 3 will implement advanced role-based access control and cross-lab security boundaries to upgrade the lab management system from **A to A+** security grade.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-tuned permissions for each lab role
- **Dynamic Role Assignment**: Runtime role changes with audit logging
- **Permission Inheritance**: Hierarchical permission structure
- **Context-Aware Access**: Lab-specific and cross-lab permission handling

### 2. Cross-Lab Security Boundaries
- **Lab Isolation**: Strict data boundaries between labs
- **Cross-Lab Collaboration**: Controlled inter-lab project sharing
- **Permission Propagation**: Secure permission inheritance across lab boundaries
- **Multi-Lab User Management**: Users with different roles in different labs

### 3. Advanced Authorization Framework
- **Resource-Level Permissions**: Granular access to specific entities
- **Time-Based Access**: Temporary permissions and role assignments
- **Conditional Access**: Context-based permission evaluation
- **Permission Caching**: Optimized permission resolution

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 3A: Enhanced Permission System
1. **Extended Permission Schema**
   - Add granular permission fields to lab members
   - Create permission templates for common roles
   - Implement permission inheritance chains

2. **Dynamic Permission Management**
   - Runtime permission updates with audit logging
   - Bulk permission changes for role updates
   - Permission conflict resolution

### Phase 3B: Cross-Lab Security
1. **Lab Boundary Enforcement**
   - Strict lab isolation in all CRUD operations
   - Cross-lab access validation
   - Lab-specific resource filtering

2. **Multi-Lab User Management**
   - User role mappings across multiple labs
   - Lab-specific permission contexts
   - Cross-lab collaboration controls

### Phase 3C: Advanced Authorization
1. **Resource-Level Access Control**
   - Entity-specific permissions (study, task, bucket level)
   - Ownership vs collaboration permissions
   - Temporary access grants

2. **Security Policy Engine**
   - Configurable security policies
   - Automated permission enforcement
   - Security rule validation

## Expected Security Upgrades

### Current State (A Grade)
- ‚úÖ Ownership validation
- ‚úÖ Admin override system
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive audit logging
- ‚ùå Limited granular permissions
- ‚ùå Basic cross-lab security
- ‚ùå No resource-level access control

### Target State (A+ Grade)
- ‚úÖ **Granular RBAC**: Fine-tuned permissions per role
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Lab Security**: Strict lab boundary enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Resource-Level Access**: Entity-specific permissions
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Permissions**: Runtime permission management
- ‚úÖ **Security Policies**: Configurable security rules
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Auditing**: Permission change tracking
